A port scanner built as a personal educational project to engage more with low-level network programming (using raw sockets and libpcap) and improve C++ proficiency.

**Status:** Work in progress. The core TCP SYN scan functionality is implemented, but the command-line interface (CLI) and other scan types are not yet complete.
